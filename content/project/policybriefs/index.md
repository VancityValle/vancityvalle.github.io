Completed in 2 separate classes, I was tasked with creating a policy brief, along with requisite recommendations that the government could implement. One such project had myself and one colleague draft a briefing note detailing Ontario's health crisis with context, describing its current challenges and providing requisite recommendations that could help to alleviate said issue. 

Another such project was one aboout the Online News Act and Online Streaming Act. An entire semester was dedicated to dissecting the two acts and their shortcomings as it pertains to their implementation in Canada. My final project was one of my own design, which was to play off the briefing note I helped prepare for the Ontario, but change it to cater to the Online News Act and Online Streaming Act. I followed the same procedure in detailing the context and giving my own recommendations.
