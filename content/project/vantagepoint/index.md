Over the past 3 years, I have been working in a team of 8 members producing content for the show Vantage Point. The content that we produce helps youth and young adults navigate the challenges of life. I am a writer for team, I am tasked with creating episodes scripts. I also double as a production assistant during our filming sections, helping fix the set to prepare for our scheduled episode filming.
