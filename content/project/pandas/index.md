 In a team of 4, my colleagues and I was tasked with creating a concept of a predominantly black television series. We were to create a visual representation of the series bible which provided reference for the show's music, characters, and locations; snippets of each act of a pilot episode; and a written series bible that developed the characters, themes, as well as a breakdown of every episode in the first season.
