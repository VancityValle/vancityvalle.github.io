abstract: The global franchise of Star Wars has been cultivating audiences for almost 50 years. An intergalactic epic illustrating the dichotomy of good versus evil in a medium universal to all. However, underlying the tones of the extravagant space battles is a political dramatization of how a democracy falls prey to fascism. Focusing specifically on Episodes 1-3, an analysis of the politics of the Galactic Senate and Emperor Palpatine was contrasted to the the rise of Hitler's Nazi Party prior to the Second World War. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: An analysis of the politics of Star Wars, and how fascism was able to fester in a democracy. Specific analysis was conducted on the Prequel trilogy, then compared to the Nazi Party in the Second World War.
