abstract:  Mixing personal experiences with academic writing, these autoethnographies dive into the human experience to help explain social and cultural phenomena. One such autoethnography that I authored illustrates our 'performance' in our everyday life, and how we conduct ourselves according to our surroundings and how our situation, in turn, informs our actions. Another autoethnography I wrote was on time and how instead of a physical clock tracking our time, I argue that the tasks that we complete each day serve as a better vehicle in understanding time.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
